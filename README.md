# Global Food Systems and Gas Emissions

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based analysis of the relationship between global food systems and greenhouse gas emissions. It provides interactive visualizations and insights into how different food production methods and dietary choices impact our environment.

## Website
[Visit the project website](https://akhipath03.github.io/FoodEmissions.github.io/)

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Tableau Public (for data visualizations)

## Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements.
3. `Scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the website.

## Features
- Interactive Tableau visualizations embedded in the webpage
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Detailed analysis of food production emissions

## Visualizations
1. Choropleth Map: Displays food emissions by country from 1990 to 2015.
2. Stacked Bar Chart: Shows the types of emissions compared to specific food products.
3. Bar Chart: Illustrates total emissions by food groups.

## Key Insights
- The project identifies major contributors to food-related greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States, Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia.
- Animal products, particularly beef, are highlighted as significant sources of emissions.
- The analysis breaks down emissions into categories such as Farm, Land Use Change, Animal Feed, and others.
- Nuts are noted for their unique negative land use change impact.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the project.
3. Use the navigation bar to explore different sections of the analysis.

## Data Sources
The project uses data from:
1. [Environment Impact of Food Production](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production)
2. [Emissions from Food](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9)

## Future Improvements
- Implement more interactive features
- Add real-time data updates
- Expand the analysis to include more recent years
- Create a mobile app version of the project
